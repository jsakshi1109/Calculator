About Calculator using XML and Java

1. Splash Activity:
The Splash Activity serves as the app's initial screen that provides a welcoming introduction. It showcases the app logo and name, contributing to brand recognition. This screen typically lasts for a few seconds before transitioning to the main calculator activity. In the background, you might perform necessary initialization tasks or resource loading.

2. Basic Calculator Activity:
In this activity, your main focus is on designing the user interface (UI) and implementing the calculator's core functionality. The UI is crafted using XML, incorporating buttons for digits, arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), equals, and a clear button. The Java code handles user interactions and calculation processes.
The Java logic captures user button presses, dynamically builds the expression, and displays it in a text view. You'll implement methods to handle arithmetic operations, and when the user presses the equals button, the expression is evaluated, and the result is displayed.

3. History Activity:
The history activity offers users a chance to review their past calculations. Users can access this feature through a navigation option, perhaps a button, from the main calculator screen. Within the history activity, you'll need to store calculation history using a local database or a storage mechanism. This history can then be displayed as a list of past calculations, allowing users to scroll through their previous work.
